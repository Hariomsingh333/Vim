## in vim we have 3 type of mode

1. normal mode => esc button
2. insert mode => i button
3. visual mode => v or shift -> v

```
esc = back to normal mode
i = insert mode
v = visual mode
```

# how to exit in vim

```
:wq = save all change and quit
:q! = discard change (no save) and quit

```

# moving the cursor in vim

```
k = go to up
j = go to down
l = go to right
h = go to left
```
# how to go inset mode to command mode 
esc = back to normal (command mode)
ctrl + c = command mode
ctrl +[ = command mode 

* ctrl + c my fav
```
o = go to insert mode in next line
O = go to insert mode in upper line

```
## some more command to go insert mode 
this command is a huge time saver so use them all in your work space 
```
a = go insert mode in left side 
shift + i = go to the beginning of the line 

```
